Mr. Driller

Instructions
============

In Mr. Driller, it is your objective to drill as many blocks as possible.
Arrow keys move Mr. Driller and change the direction that he drills in.
Space bar drills in whichever direction Mr. Driller's drill is facing.

Blocks of the same color will connect and form groups, which fall together and
are drilled together.
There are two types of special blocks:
- air blocks
- durable blocks

Mr. Driller has a dwindling air supply, so to continue drilling, he must collect
air blocks. Durable blocks require three hits to drill through and, when drilled
through, they deplete 20% of your air supply.

If a block falls on Mr. Driller or if he runs out of air, he loses a life.
Mr. Driller has three lives, and when tthey are gone, it's game over.


Ideas Used from Class
=====================

We made use of only HTML5 canvas and Javascript. We used object oriented
programming to make Driller and Block objects with their own fields and methods.
However, we avoided object prototyping and inheritance.

We used keyboard event handling and a timer events to control logic for falling
blocks and redrawing of the canvas.

We used closures in some cases to make code more compact and concise.
We used recursion! YEAH!

We used optional parameters for some functions, allowing function overloading.
